My firt attempt at making a proper videogame using the Godot game engine.
Currently in early development.

Pineapple is a short arcade action game with roguelike elements for PC. You play as a superhero that must protect a magical pineapple sprout, the source of his powers, from waves of robots attempting to steal it's fruits.
Keep moving to keep up with streams of enemies from all around and gain speed to power up your attacks.

Planned features:
smooth-player movement with a feeling of control and momentum
Combo system that encourages players to go fast
9 different enemies
1 boss enemy
6 unlockable player attacks
Controler support
2 languages (PT-PT, ENG)
Cell-shaded 3D models
